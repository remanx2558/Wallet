/**
 * Repository interface for managing {@link TransModel} entities.
 *
 * <p>This interface extends both {@link JpaRepository} and {@link PagingAndSortingRepository}:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code JpaRepository<TransModel, Integer>} provides CRUD operations, pagination, sorting,
 *       and JPA-specific functionalities.</li>
 *   <li>{@code PagingAndSortingRepository<TransModel, Integer>} also provides methods for pagination
 *       and sorting, although it's generally redundant since {@code JpaRepository} already inherits
 *       from it. Here, it's explicitly included for illustration.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>By extending these Spring Data JPA interfaces, you get a variety of methods without writing
 * their implementationsâ€”Spring provides them at runtime. You can also define additional query
 * methods by following the naming conventions of Spring Data JPA, or by using annotations like
 * {@code @Query} for more complex queries.</p>
 *
 *
 * <p></>It is used for performing CRUD operations and pagination on the TransModel entity.
 * </p>
 * <p>findAll(Pageable pageable): Retrieves all entities sorted by the given Pageable object.
 * findAll(Sort sort): Retrieves all entities sorted by the given Sort object.
 * findAllById(Iterable<ID> ids, Pageable pageable): Retrieves a page of entities with the specified IDs and Pageable object.
 * findAllById(Iterable<ID> ids, Sort sort): Retrieves entities with the specified IDs and sorts them according to the given Sort object.</p>
